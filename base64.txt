// we use base 64 encoding to send large data(such as image/text/vid) between multiple systems(internet) safely and reliably without any risk
// of corrupting data or interoperability issue ; for eg ; ASCII use 7bits per char which is different from common modern computer that use byte
// (8bits/char) therefore some parser might be broken to interpret or could execute uncessary modification on data thus yeilding corrupted
// results;
// The function that produce the hash are often called hash function or message digests and the output of that fx is called "digests"'
// The digest itself is a string of bits with a fixed length; for eg; sha256 algorithm produce a digest with the length of 256 bits;

// BASE64 encoding methods:
// texts -> breaks into byte code(8bits) -> grouping byte code into contigious sequence of bit
// -> divide into multiple groups with each letter consists of 4 bits -> convert those 4 bits into new decimal value -> use lookup to base64
// table to find new letter -> regroup back

/* Each 3 letter is transform into 4 new letters in base64 encoding value; If the letter is not enough it will add padding to fill its place*/
// NOTE :  padding is just "=" sign to add to existed letter;
// Formula factor the input of byte in ASCII and output in base64 = 4[1/3n] (general-overhead = 33%)
// n is the number of given byte from ASCII input with the maximum of only 3 letters;
